# TrafficModeling

The electrification of the mobility sector turns cars into a major concern for electricity grid operation for the first time in history. The charging and discharging capacities of parked electric vehicle batteries can be of use or create a problem to the operation of highly renewable electricity systems. It hence becomes necessary to model parking behaviour on the scale of entire cities. Here, we introduce a method for doing this. 

We provide a tutorial as Jupyter Notebook instructions in the file **tutorial.ipynb** and a contiguous code in the file **main.jl** and the folder **src**. The programs are written in Julia programming language. We suggest to use version 1.0
