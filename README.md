# City-scale car traffic and parking density modeling with Uber travel time data

The electrification of the mobility sector turns cars into a major concern for electricity grid operation for the first time in history. The charging and discharging capacities of parked electric vehicle batteries can be of use or create a problem to the operation of highly renewable electricity systems. It hence becomes necessary to model parking behaviour on the scale of entire cities. Here, we introduce a method for doing this. 

We provide a tutorial as Jupyter Notebook instructions in the file **tutorial.ipynb** and a contiguous code in the file **main.jl** and the folder **src**. The code is written in the programming language Julia 1.0.1. For citation, use:
